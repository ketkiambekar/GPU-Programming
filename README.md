# GPU-Programming
GPU programs for high performance computing

This section contains two projects. Both projects calculate dot products using parallel programming. 
However, one uses CUDA while the other one does it using OpenMP. 

The folders contains all the requisite input and component files along with instructions on how to execute them on a GPU or a GPU cluster.
