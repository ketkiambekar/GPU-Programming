This program calculates dot products in parallelized loops that utilize the GPU processors and substantially reduce the computational time. 

The programs take a matrix and a vector as inputs and prints the dot products of the inputs onto the console. We see that the runtime reduces drastically for large inputs. 

Instructions for running this program on a cluster.
Run the following commands.

1)Type command 'make all' to compile the program files
2)Run the command 'qsub sgescript'
3)Output should get created in the file called 'dotprod_output'
